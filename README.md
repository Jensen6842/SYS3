# Systems & Devices 3: Advanced Computer Systems

## Description
This module continues the Systems and Devices stream by considering advanced computer systems in terms of their structure and how it affects their programming. <br />
To this point, the systems introduced have been basic uniprocessors with simple memory. <br />
The module starts by introducing the concept of multiple processor architectures, pipelined and superscalar processors, systems-on-chip and advanced memory structures, including caches.

The rest of the module considers how these hardware features affect the way that such modern systems are efficiently programmed. <br />
Issues of programming for pipelines, caches, etc. are considered. <br />
Then how processes running in parallel on separate processors can share underlying resources safely. <br />
Finally, the module considers building blocks for parallel programming, e.g. threads and communication. <br />
It will also consider how such constructs map to processor instructions. <br />
The module will consider real-world examples throughout.
